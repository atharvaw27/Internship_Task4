# Overview of the Project

**Objective**

The objective of the code is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that classifies emails as either "spam" or "not spam" based on their content.

**Features**

**Dataset Handling:**

Loads email dataset (task4_dataset.csv) with columns text (email content) and label (1 for spam, 0 for not spam).

**Text Preprocessing:**

Converts text data into numerical features using CountVectorizer, which applies the bag-of-words model and removes English stop words.

**Data Splitting:**

Divides the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split (train_test_split).

**Model Training:**

Uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, suitable for text classification tasks.

**Prediction:**

Predicts the labels (spam or not spam) on the test set.

**Model Evaluation:**

Calculates the accuracy of the model.

Provides a classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score for both spam and non-spam classes.

**Key Libraries Used:**

pandas for dataset manipulation.

sklearn for text feature extraction, model training, and evaluation metrics.
